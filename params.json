Users can either create or load an aquarium.\r\n2. To create an aquarium, go to the AddFish option on the menu bar and select fish of your choice from the menu option.\r\n3. User can also add aquarium decor from the AddTreasure menu option.\r\n4. User can clone every item present in the aquarium.\r\n5. If user wishes to remove any fish he can do so by activating the trash can from the Files menu option.\r\n6. Once user drags item over the trash can, the item will be automatically deleted.\r\n7. The user can now save his aquarium environment by selecting SaveAs from the File menu option.\r\n8. He is welcome to reload this file and make changes by selecting the 'load' option from menu.\r\n9. At any point the user can exit the aquarium setting by hitting 'Exit' under the Files tab.\r\n\r\n## About the Game:\r\n\r\nThe motive of this game is for the user to make sure that all the preys are eaten before the environment gets dirty. The user doesn't know which fish are preys or which fish are predators. The user adds fish in the aquarium. He needs to observe which fish behaves how and figure out which ones are predator fish. Once he has them figured out, the user is required to add multiple predators in the aquarium in order to eliminate all the preys. The time limit for the user to eliminate all the prey fish is 45 seconds because that's when the environment gets dirty.\r\n\r\n## User Interface:\r\n\r\nThis game requires the user to use the mouse in order to add the fish to the aquarium. Other than that, observe and notice how each fish acts differently. Once you spot the difference in behavior, be quick to add the Predators to your aquarium because you only have 45seconds before the environment gets dirty. Don't worry you will be able to tell when the environment gets dirty and we will give you a 10 second heads up too! And we've also added a helpful feature for your preys. What is it? Well look for our 'Hint' option! Other than that feel free to scroll up and down the aquarium and re size the screen however you please. Mouse, Eyes and Fish will be your best friends to win this game ;)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
