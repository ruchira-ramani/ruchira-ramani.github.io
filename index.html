<a name="about-the-game" class="anchor" href="#about-the-game"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the Game:</h2>

<p>The motive of this game is for the user to make sure that all the preys are eaten before the environment gets dirty. The user doesn't know which fish are preys or which fish are predators. The user adds fish in the aquarium. He needs to observe which fish behaves how and figure out which ones are predator fish. Once he has them figured out, the user is required to add multiple predators in the aquarium in order to eliminate all the preys. The time limit for the user to eliminate all the prey fish is 45 seconds because that's when the environment gets dirty.</p>

<a name="user-interface" class="anchor" href="#user-interface"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User Interface:</h2>

<p>This game requires the user to use the mouse in order to add the fish to the aquarium. Other than that, observe and notice how each fish acts differently. Once you spot the difference in behavior, be quick to add the Predators to your aquarium because you only have 45seconds before the environment gets dirty. Don't worry you will be able to tell when the environment gets dirty and we will give you a 10 second heads up too! And we've also added a helpful feature for your preys. What is it? Well look for our 'Hint' option! Other than that feel free to scroll up and down the aquarium and re size the screen however you please. Mouse, Eyes and Fish will be your best friends to win this game ;)</p>
